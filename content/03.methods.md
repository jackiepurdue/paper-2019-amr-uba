## Methods

### Data

We surveyed four separate databases to assess the diversity of known and candidate AMR genes.
These sources include CARD canonical and prevalence (version 3.0.5) sequences for the AMR genes under study, and associated homologs from NCBI non-redundant data and metagenomic data.
The 32 canonical MCR sequence variants (table {@tbl:mcr-variants}), 18 canonical KPC sequence variants (table {@tbl:kpc-variants}), 14 canonical NDM sequence variants (table {@tbl:ndm-variants}), and 6 canonical OXA-48-like sequence variants(table {@tbl:oxa-variants}), as labeled in the CARD database, were obtained as a reference. The AMR prevalence data was derived from CARD Prevalence 3.0.5. 
The NCBI non-redundant data consisted of all non-redundant GenBank, Protein Data Bank (PDB), SwissProt, Protein information resource (PIR), Protein research foundation (PRF) data from May 17, 2019.
The metagenomic data came from a data-set of 7903 draft quality MAGs which were recovered from the Sequence Read Archive by Parks [@doi:10/cczd]. These genomes were chosen specifically because they were likely to be from lineages which were under-sampled, environmental and non-human gastrointestinal samples being the main focus.

### Querying the data

The CARD canonical sequences from each family were used to perform a multiple query BLASTP (version 2.5.0 [@doi:10/cnsjsz]) against the prevalence BLAST database with an e-value threshold and query coverages shown in table 1. 
Many of the sequences are nearly identical, thus they were further processed by clustering with CD-HIT version 4.8.1 at a minimum sequence identity as per table 1.

The reference CARD canonical sequences were also used to perform a multiple query BLASTP against the NCBI non-redundant database with an e-value and query coverage threshold indicated in table 1
There are many highly sampled taxa and genes in the non-redundant database. 
To balance the distribution, and reduce the size of the non-redundant sequence set, CD-HIT version 4.8.1 was also used to cluster the data as per table 1.

For the metagenomic data, RGI version 5.0 with CARD database version 3.02 [@doi:10/f9wbjs] was run on the contigs of the 7903 MAGs with the inclusion of loose, perfect, and strict hits.
The search strings in table s1 were used to extract results from the RGI output.
The CARD canonical sequences were used to perform a multiple query BLASTP against this UBA blast database with a e-value threshold and query coverage from table 1.
The minimum BLAST query coverages were chosen to produce meaningful alignments.

For all sequence variants obtained from each data source, redundant results for the prevalence, NCBI, and UBA queries were filtered from these BLASTP results by retrieving only the longest sequence for each unique Subject Taxonomy ID.

### Sequence Alignment

Two alignments were created for each AMR determinant under study.
The first alignment was created to compare the phylogenetic relationship of the canonical and prevalence (putaive) sequences.
The second alignment was created for an comparison of sequences from all four databases.

The putative AMR alignment was made up of the sequences from the CARD prevalence data were combined in one multi-FASTA format file with the canonical sequences and an outgroup chosen for each AMR family as per table ?? [TODO: make a table of outgroups in supplemental]. 
In the second, more diverse alignment, The filtered sequences from NCBI non-redundant data, CARD prevalence data, UBA data were all combined into one multi-FASTA format file with the canonical sequences with the same outgroup sequences (table ??).

This set of combined amino acid sequences were aligned with MAFFT-LINSI [@doi:dbpmq3] version 7.40 and trimmed by trimal [@doi:bjhdh7] version 1.4.rev22 using the automated1 option.

### Creation of phylogenies

For each alignment under each AMR family under study, IQ-TREE multicore version 1.6.9 [@doi:10/f3srtd] was used to build a bootstrapped tree with -bb 1000 with the G+I+G4 model of substitution. 
Tree visualizations were created with ETE Toolkit [@doi:gfzpph] version 3.
The trees were annotated with taxonomic information for each rank by using ETE’s NCBI taxonomy module to translate the names result set from the various databases to taxonomic identifiers.
The taxonomic identifier was used to query NCBI's taxonomy database from May 17, 2019, for the taxonomy information.
In cases where there were multiple hits for genes, the most recent common ancestor was used to query the taxonomic information, therefore some leaves in the trees were annotated with only partial taxonomic information.
