CARD focuses on providing high-quality reference data and molecular sequences within a controlled vocabulary, the Antibiotic Resistance Ontology (ARO), designed by the CARD biocuration team to integrate with software development efforts for resistome analysis and prediction, such as CARD’s Resistance Gene Identifier (RGI) software. Since 2017, CARD has expanded through extensive curation of reference sequences, revision of the ontological structure, curation of over 500 new AMR detection models, development of a new classification paradigm and expansion of analytical tools. Most notably, a new Resistomes &amp; Variants module provides analysis and statistical summary of in silico predicted resistance variants from 82 pathogens and over 100 000 genomes. By adding these resistance variants to CARD, we are able to summarize predicted resistance using the information included in CARD, identify trends in AMR mobility and determine previously undescribed and novel resistance variants. Here, we describe updates and recent expansions to CARD and its biocuration process, including new resources for community biocuration of AMR molecular reference data.</jats:p>",

Antimicrobial resistance in Gram-negative bacteria is an emerging and serious global public health threat. Carbapenems have been used as the “last-line” treatment for infections caused by resistant Enterobacteriaceae, including those producing extended spectrum ß-lactamases. However, Enterobacteriaceae that produce carbapenemases, which are enzymes that deactivate carbapenems and most other ß-lactam antibiotics, have emerged and are increasingly being reported worldwide. Despite this increasing burden, the most optimal treatment for CRE infections is largely unknown. For the few remaining available treatment options, there are limited efficacy data to support their role in therapy. Nevertheless, current treatment options include the use of older agents, such as polymyxins, fosfomycin, and aminoglycosides, which have been rarely used due to efficacy and/or toxicity concerns. Optimization of dosing regimens and combination therapy are additional treatment strategies being explored. Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae infections are associated with poor outcomes and high mortality. Continued research is critically needed to determine the most appropriate treatment.</jats:p>",

Many varieties of the enzyme can be distinguished on the basis of their catalytic and molecular properties, but only amino acid sequence determination gives information upon which a molecular phylogeny can be based. The present evidence suggests that the β-lactamases have a polyphyletic origin. All the β-lactamases of currently known amino acid sequence belong to one homology group, here called class A enzymes.

Based on these characteristics, the isolates were assigned to the genus <jats:italic>Psychrobacter</jats:italic>. Based on their SDS-PAGE profiles, the 12 isolates could be categorized into three groups.

The molecular classification is based on the amino acid sequence and divides β-lactamases into class A, C, and D enzymes which utilize serine for β-lactam hydrolysis and class B metalloenzymes which require divalent zinc ions for substrate hydrolysis. The functional classification scheme updated herein is based on the 1995 proposal by Bush et al. (K. Bush, G. A. Jacoby, and A. A. Medeiros, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 39:1211-1233, 1995). It takes into account substrate and inhibitor profiles in an attempt to group the enzymes in ways that can be correlated with their phenotype in clinical isolates. Major groupings generally correlate with the more broadly based molecular classification. The updated system includes group 1 (class C) cephalosporinases; group 2 (classes A and D) broad-spectrum, inhibitor-resistant, and extended-spectrum β-lactamases and serine carbapenemases; and group 3 metallo-β-lactamases. Several new subgroups of each of the major groups are described, based on specific attributes of individual enzymes. A list of attributes is also suggested for the description of a new β-lactamase, including the requisite microbiological properties, substrate and inhibitor profiles, and molecular sequence data that provide an adequate characterization for a new β-lactam-hydrolyzing enzyme.</jats:p>",

In total, six OXA-436-producing <jats:named-content content-type=\"genus-species\">Enterobacteriaceae</jats:named-content> isolates, including <jats:named-content content-type=\"genus-species\">Enterobacter asburiae</jats:named-content> (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 3), <jats:named-content content-type=\"genus-species\">Citrobacter freundii</jats:named-content> (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 2), and <jats:named-content content-type=\"genus-species\">Klebsiella pneumoniae</jats:named-content> (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 1), were identified in four patients in the period between September 2013 and April 2015. All three species of OXA-436-producing <jats:named-content content-type=\"genus-species\">Enterobacteriaceae</jats:named-content> were found in one patient. The amino acid sequence of OXA-436 showed 90.4 to 92.8% identity to the amino acid sequences of other acquired OXA-48-like variants. Expression of OXA-436 in <jats:named-content content-type=\"genus-species\">Escherichia coli</jats:named-content> and kinetic analysis of purified OXA-436 revealed an activity profile similar to that of OXA-48 and OXA-181, with activity against penicillins, including temocillin; limited or no activity against extended-spectrum cephalosporins; and activity against carbapenems. The <jats:italic>bla</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:sub>OXA-436</jats:sub> gene was located on a conjugative ∼314-kb IncHI2/IncHI2A plasmid belonging to plasmid multilocus sequence typing sequence type 1 in a region surrounded by chromosomal genes previously identified to be adjacent to <jats:italic>bla</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:sub>OXA</jats:sub> genes in <jats:named-content content-type=\"genus-species\">Shewanella</jats:named-content> spp. In conclusion, OXA-436 is a novel CHDL with functional properties similar to those of OXA-48-like CHDLs.

N. Philippon, T. Naas, A.-T. Bouthors, V. Barakett, and P. Nordmann, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 41:2188–2195, 1997). A second β-lactamase was cloned, and the recombinant <jats:italic>Escherichia coli</jats:italic> clone pPL10 expressed a pI 7.4 β-lactamase which conferred high levels of amoxicillin and ticarcillin resistance and which was partially inhibited by clavulanic acid. The 2.5-kb insert from pPL10 was sequenced, and a 266-amino-acid protein (OXA-20) was deduced; this protein has low amino acid identity with most of the class D β-lactamases except OXA-2, OXA-15, and OXA-3 (75% amino acid identity with each). OXA-20 is a restricted-spectrum oxacillinase and is unusually inhibited by clavulanic acid. OXA-20 is a peculiar β-lactamase because its translation initiates with a TTG (leucine) codon, which is rarely used as a translational origin in bacteria.

In parallel with the molecular revolution in microbiology, several new species have been identified on a phylogenetic basis, and the genome of the type species, <jats:italic>A. hydrophila</jats:italic> ATCC 7966, has been sequenced. In addition to established disease associations, <jats:italic>Aeromonas</jats:italic> has been shown to be a significant cause of infections associated with natural disasters (hurricanes, tsunamis, and earthquakes) and has been linked to emerging or new illnesses, including near-drowning events, prostatitis, and hemolytic-uremic syndrome. Despite these achievements, issues still remain regarding the role that <jats:italic>Aeromonas</jats:italic> plays in bacterial gastroenteritis, the extent to which species identification should be attempted in the clinical laboratory, and laboratory reporting of test results from contaminated body sites containing aeromonads. This article provides an extensive review of these topics, in addition to others, such as taxonomic issues, microbial pathogenicity, and antimicrobial resistance markers.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

Typically, they derive from genes for TEM-1, TEM-2, or SHV-1 by mutations that alter the amino acid configuration around the active site of these β-lactamases. This extends the spectrum of β-lactam antibiotics susceptible to hydrolysis by these enzymes. An increasing number of ESBLs not of TEM or SHV lineage have recently been described. The presence of ESBLs carries tremendous clinical significance. The ESBLs are frequently plasmid encoded. Plasmids responsible for ESBL production frequently carry genes encoding resistance to other drug classes (for example, aminoglycosides). Therefore, antibiotic options in the treatment of ESBL-producing organisms are extremely limited. Carbapenems are the treatment of choice for serious infections due to ESBL-producing organisms, yet carbapenem-resistant isolates have recently been reported. ESBL-producing organisms may appear susceptible to some extended-spectrum cephalosporins. However, treatment with such antibiotics has been associated with high failure rates. There is substantial debate as to the optimal method to prevent this occurrence. It has been proposed that cephalosporin breakpoints for the <jats:italic>Enterobacteriaceae</jats:italic> should be altered so that the need for ESBL detection would be obviated. At present, however, organizations such as the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (formerly the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards) provide guidelines for the detection of ESBLs in klebsiellae and <jats:italic>Escherichia coli</jats:italic>. In common to all ESBL detection methods is the general principle that the activity of extended-spectrum cephalosporins against ESBL-producing organisms will be enhanced by the presence of clavulanic acid. ESBLs represent an impressive example of the ability of gram-negative bacteria to develop new antibiotic resistance mechanisms in the face of the introduction of new antimicrobial agents.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> A global medical crisis is unfolding as antibiotics lose effectiveness against a growing number of bacterial pathogens. Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) contributes significantly to the rapid spread of resistance, yet the transmission dynamics of genes that confer antibiotic resistance are poorly understood. Multiple mechanisms of HGT liberate genes from normal vertical inheritance. Conjugation by plasmids, transduction by bacteriophages, and natural transformation by extracellular DNA each allow genetic material to jump between strains and species. Thus, HGT adds an important dimension to infectious disease whereby an antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) can be the agent of an outbreak by transferring resistance to multiple unrelated pathogens. Here, we review the small number of cases where HGT has been detected in clinical environments. We discuss differences and synergies between the spread of plasmid-borne and chromosomal ARGs, with a special consideration of the difficulties of detecting transduction and transformation by routine genetic diagnostics. We highlight how 11 of the top 12 priority antibiotic-resistant pathogens are known or predicted to be naturally transformable, raising the possibility that this mechanism of HGT makes significant contributions to the spread of ARGs. HGT drives the evolution of untreatable “superbugs” by concentrating ARGs together in the same cell, thus HGT must be included in strategies to prevent the emergence of resistant organisms in hospitals and other clinical settings. </jats:p>",

Understanding the resistance mechanisms of these bacteria is crucial for the development of novel antimicrobial agents or other alternative tools to combat these public health challenges. Greater mechanistic understanding would also aid in the prediction of underlying or even unknown mechanisms of resistance, which could be applied to other emerging multidrug resistant pathogens.

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance associated with colistin has emerged as a significant concern worldwide threatening the use of one of the most important antimicrobials for treating human disease. Here, we examined a collection (n = 980) of Avian Pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) isolated from poultry with colibacillosis from the US and internationally for the presence of mcr-1 and mcr-2, genes known to encode colistin resistance. Included in the analysis was an additional set of avian fecal E. coli (AFEC) (n = 220) isolates from healthy birds for comparative analysis. The mcr-1 gene was detected in a total of 12 isolates recovered from diseased production birds from China and Egypt. No mcr genes were detected in the healthy fecal isolates. The full mcr-1 gene from positive isolates was sequenced using specifically designed primers and were compared with sequences currently described in NCBI. mcr-1 positive isolates were also assessed for phenotypic colistin resistance and extended spectrum beta lactam phenotypes and genotypes. This study has identified mcr-1 in APEC isolates dating back to at least 2010 and suggests that animal husbandry practices could result in a potential source of resistance to the human food chain in countries where application of colistin in animal health is practiced.",
